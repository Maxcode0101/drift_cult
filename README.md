**Drift Cult** is a modern, full-stack e-commerce web application built using Django, PostgreSQL, and Stripe. It serves as the online storefront for a countercultural surf, skate, and outdoor clothing brand that emphasizes durability, authenticity, and non-mainstream values.

The application is designed for a niche community of independent, style-conscious individuals who reject fast fashion in favor of minimalist design and long-lasting quality. The platform provides a streamlined shopping experience, allowing users to browse curated products, manage their cart, and complete secure purchases.

From a technical perspective, Drift Cult incorporates user authentication via Allauth, dynamic product filtering, Stripe-powered payment flows, responsive UI with Bootstrap 4, automated confirmation emails, and an admin interface for managing inventory and orders. Media files are hosted via AWS S3, and the application is deployed on Heroku with PostgreSQL as the production database.

Drift Cult reflects both a technical implementation of best practices and a brand-driven digital experience that connects directly with its target audience.
